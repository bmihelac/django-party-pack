Why Sphinxified Django?
=======================

Because these are great patterns and tools that beginners should be exposed to right away. I've learned them from the various :ref:`contributors`, who of whom are all people I admire as Django and Python developers.

As for the name, it was inspired by the wonderful `Sphinx`_ project.
